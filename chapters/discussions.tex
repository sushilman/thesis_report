\section{Performance Findings}

\section{Non-Functional Requirements of the Framework}

\subsection{Scalability}
Scalable at different component levels. Isolates, Isolate System, Message Queuing System and clustering of Message Broker (RabbitMQ). Better scalability is obtained when the Message Queuing System is scaled out.

\subsection{Availability}
Can be designed to make highly available. Apparently, no downtime to deploy new code to a running system.

\subsection{Reliability}

\section{Problems/Issues}
\subsection{Dart Induced Issues}
  * The Unimplemented functionalities of Isolates
    - KILL
    - PAUSE
    - PING
    - Supervision of Isolates
  * Isolate are not lightweight.
  * Running Isolates in web (Dartium)
  *
