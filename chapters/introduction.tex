\chapter{Introduction}\label{chapter:introduction}
  To scale up and handle a high number of requests, applications are deployed in distributed environments. The transfer speed and demand for data have been increasing rapidly. Performance expectations from web applications are higher than ever.
  %Why? Because of fast growing information technology?
  % because of increasing number of users?
  % growing usage of smartphones is also one of the reasons
Performance and scalability concerns are met by using high end multi-core servers and concurrent processing via multi-threading.

  Enterprises want their applications to be available 100\% of the time because a few seconds of application downtime could cause a huge loss to revenue and customer satisfaction.

  Ideally an application should be able to scale up or down without compromising its availability. The possibility of dynamically adjusting scalability allows an application to grow when demand increases and shrink to minimal resources when demand is low.

  Deploying applications to distributed environments is a good solution for scaling up, but most applications fail to utilize all available physical resources because of their underlying design.

  The actor programming model~[\autoref{sec:actorProgramming}] allows developers to build highly concurrent, distributed and fault tolerant event-driven applications. These characteristics are provided by actors which use asynchronous message passing~[\autoref{sec:messagePassing}]. Actor implementations were first created in 1980s, but only recently have become mainstream.

  The work presented in this thesis focuses on creating a framework for the Dart language~[\autoref{sec:dart}] that allows developers to create asynchronous, concurrent, scalable and distributed applications. The concept of scalability in the framework is based on the actor-like nature of isolates~[\autoref{sec:isolates}], which communicate solely by message passing. The framework takes advantage of isolates and extends its functionality so that they can be deployed into distributed systems.

  The framework is intended to take advantage of the fact that the Dart virtual machine can be run in browser as well as in server. This advantage opens up the possibility of creating a fully distributed application in which isolates may run everywhere: in servers, desktop browsers and even in mobile browsers.

  Erlang~[\autoref{sec:erlang}] and Scala~[\autoref{sec:scala}] are popular programming languages which have their own implementation of actor programming. The Akka toolkit~[\autoref{sec:akka}] provides a foundation for actor programming in both Java and Scala. The DDE framework presented in this thesis draws on ideas from the actor system~[\autoref{subsec:actorSystem}] and router~[\autoref{subsec:akka-routers}]
   implementations of Akka to provide a comparable isolate system~[\autoref{sub:isolate-system}] and routers~[\autoref{subsubsec:router}] for Dart.

  As applications of the DDE framework are based on message passing, the framework takes advantages of features offered by the message broker system â€“ RabbitMQ~[\autoref{sec:rabbitmq}]. RabbitMQ provides message persistence and a decoupled nature to applications built on the DDE framework.

  To provide a fully distributed nature to applications the DDE framework allows developers to deploy components of their application (Worker isolate~[\autoref{subsubsec:worker}]) to remote nodes, which is achieved by serializing messages through WebSockets~[\autoref{sec:websocket}]. The DDE framework itself is based on asynchronous message passing. It has several decoupled components which communicate with each other via WebSockets~[\autoref{sec:websocket}].

  The result of this thesis is a framework based on the Dart language that enforces actor based programming in Dart and makes applications scalable, highly available, with support for deploying and terminating isolates at runtime without interrupting the whole system.

 Chapter \ref{chapter:literature_review} consists of the introduction and references of the concepts behind the DDE framework. It also discusses the technologies that were used in the framework. Chapter \ref{chapter:system_design} presents the implementation ideas and proof of concept of Dart Dart Everywhere. Chapter \ref{chapter:results} shows sample applications built using this framework and presents performance benchmarks and evaluations of applications ran in a distributed environment in Amazon EC2. The deductions made from the benchmarks and results are discussed in \autoref{chapter:discussions}.
