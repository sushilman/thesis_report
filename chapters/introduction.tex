\section{Background}
TODO
% Multi-core processors make concurrency an essential ingredient of efficient program execution. Moreover, the Distributed computing and web services are inherently concurrent. Message-based concurrency is attractive because it might provide a way to address the two challenges at the same time. It can be seen as a higher-level model for threads with the potential to generalize to distributed computation. Many message passing systems used in practice are instantiations of the actor model. A popular implementation of this form of concurrency is the Erlang programming language. Erlang supports massively concurrent systems such as telephone exchanges by using a very lightweight implementation of concurrent processes.~\cite{Haller}
%
%   The purpose of this thesis is to build a framework based on the actor programming model and the Dart language. The framework unifies applications across devices, client and server and also supports migration of actors in a distributed system. So, first of all we should briefly overview the actor programming model and how it can be realized efficiently in the Dart language. Although the actor model was introduced in mid 1980s and there had been programming languages like Erlang that implemented it, only now it has started gaining wide popularity in distributed systems. Especially after the introduction of Scala and Akka, the actor model has been gaining good popularity.
%
%   The Dart programming language provides a homogeneous system that encompasses both client as well as server as the Dart Virtual Machine runs in servers as well as in browsers. This particular nature of the Dart language makes it possible to create a fully distributed application in which isolates (the actor like entities of Dart language) may run everywhere in servers, in desktop browsers and even in mobile browsers.
% This thesis is about creating a framework that would take the Dart's actor like entities knows as ‘Isolates’ to a distributed system with added capabilities.

\section{Goals}
TODO
%   Create a framework for writing programs in the Dart Language that enforces the actor based programming model such that the final system is inherently distributed in nature.
% The framework should make improve the ‘availability’ of an application that is built on top of it.
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item The framework shall make the application scalable at different levels.
%     \item The framework shall support hot deployments and migration of Isolates, which improves the availability of the system.
% \end{itemize}
