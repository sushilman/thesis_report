\chapter{Future Directions}\label{chapter:future_directions}

Some notes for future directions:
 * If a code upgrade fails, the isolate should be reverted to its previous state.
 * Lightweight isolates -> future dart impl?
 * Detect all sort of exceptions in child isolate -> which would make it possible to implement supervisors and let it crash philosophy. -> future dart impl?, should be available in near future in dart.
