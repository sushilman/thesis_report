\chapter{Future Directions}\label{chapter:future_directions}

%   The work done in the DDE framework in this thesis may be extended in number of directions. First, .. needs ... to further improve programmability. Introduction of tools for unit testing the code would help developers to write quality codes. ... Better implementation of supervision strategy. Automatic load balancing and migration of isolates to another system based on different factors?


% .... opens the possibility of ...
%

% Dart runs in browsers thus isolates can be made to run in browsers provided that ... dart implement those possibility.


%
% Some notes for future directions:
%  * If a code upgrade fails, the isolate should be reverted to its previous state.
%  * Lightweight isolates -> future dart impl?

%  * Detect all sort of exceptions in child isolate -> which would make it possible to implement supervisors and let it crash philosophy. -> future dart impl?, should be available in near future in dart.
