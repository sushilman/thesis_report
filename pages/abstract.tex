\chapter{\abstractname}

  A framework that allows developers to create concurrent, scalable and fault-tolerant applications with high availability in the Dart language is developed in this thesis.

  The \emph{isolate} of the Dart language is an interesting entity inspired by the actor model. Their nature of having no shared access to memory and relying on messages for communication makes them asynchronous and decoupled in nature. Nevertheless, their limitation of being able to be spawned only in a local Dart virtual machine restricts them from being distributed. The \acrshort{DDE} (Dart Dart Everywhere) framework built as a result of this thesis uses the advantages of the Dart language enhancing it with libraries for remote management, hot deployment of code and distributed execution. The framework provides its own implementation of actors and allows developers to build applications that are inherently distributed in nature.
