      -> Not Addressed: Security issues ...

  3. General Design Decisions
    -> Description of architecture, theory
    -> Explain the components of framework
    -> Scalability -> scalable at multiple levels -> from isolates / isolateSystem / message queuing system / message broker system [even Registry is scalable!]
    -> Reconfigurability and Extensibility of the Framework

    -> Explain how parallelism is obtained? multiple isolates behind the scene with router / load balancer in front of them?
    => Implementation Details??
      -> ?

4. Results -> FACTS only !! (from the most important to the least important)
  1. Testing and Benchmarking
    -> Mention negative as well as positive (Do not interpret, save it for Discussions Section)
      -> Poor results in micro instances with low network performance
      -> Sudden breakdown when too many nodes dequeuing at once in single MQS (Just Mention Fact, no assumptions)
      -> Refer to akka framework and make comparisons where applicable
    -> ? Include results of message sending to/from isolates via SendPort before & after serialization of Map data types?

6. Discussions (10-15?)
   -> Analysis of result
    -> What are major patterns in observations?
    -> Interpret observed results, put forward hypotheses & possibilities
    -> Compare one-way send vs send receive, and explain why send-receive is significantly slower compared to simply consume

7. Conclusion (5-10)
8. Recommendations
  -> Future works?
    -> Security
    -> Interceptors -> will esp assist in unit tests and performance tests
    -> Separate package for Browsers implementation
    -> Dead letters concept like in akka
    -> Proper Supervision (which is currently limited because of limitation of dart isolates)
    ->

10. Appendices
  -> Codes
  -> Tools used ?


===================Interesting NOTES===================================
=> from Agha (A model of Concurrent Computation in Distributed Systems)

If the underlying system is required to buffer segments of a communication it can equally well be required to buffer different communications so that the sender does ot have to be busy waiting" for the receiver to accept a communication before it proceeds to do sorne other processing.
Thus buffered asynchronous communication affords efficiency in execution by pipelining the actions to be performed.
Such buffers are readily defined actor languages.

The guarantee of delivery of communications is impossible because of buffering and presence of network !

An actor may be described by specifying:
* its mail address, to which there corresponds a sufficiently large mail queue; and,
* its behavior, which is a function of the communication accepted. <- [this is what our framework assumes ? Each Isolate is a functional component and only accepts certain types of message]

[-> Creating Isolates for every message is not meaningful]

================================================================================================================================================
Advantages of framework :
  -> Add and remove nodes on the fly !
  -> Not all messages are lost when node fails, except which are/were already in the internal queue of the node
  -> Simplifies Communication between actors to certain degree !
  -> Communicate with isolates on remote node and on another system, which is not possible in Dart Isolate


 Cons:
  -> Isolates are heavy compared to Actors in Akka
  -> Spawning takes time + memory
  -> May be spawning too many actors like in Akka is not a good practice?

=================================================================================================================================================
Design Decisions:
  -> General Question: Why 'A' over 'B'?
    eg: Why websocket server in Activator over having webSocket server in isolatesystem? The worker could use websocket client to connect to isolatesystem, which would even make it independent and run without isolate system, would even run in browser?
    Then isolatesystem cannot be run in browser but isolates/workers can be !
      -> Explanation: This way each worker would need a separate websocket connection with Isolate System. Too many connections will be needed to be handled ? Not the router or any other component by the isolate system will have to handle incoming websocket requests? is it possible to delegate to router, may be not because a websocket cannot be sent as a message?


================================
Compare this Framework with Actor model, impacts, advantages?


===============
CLUSTER:
  ->
 -> Availability -> does it improve?
 -> improves scalability
 -> improve durability?

 Because the messages are stored in this system cap theorem applies to it. Depends on how rabbitMQ.
"CAP theorem"
Consistency
Availability
Partition Tolerant

CAP theorem applies usually in cluster

  -> Higher availability: if a node fails other will continue processing!
  -> Performance : to some degree it is true that performance improves
  ->

  Improve monitoring, fault tolerance,
